The code files should be executed in the following order, so that all the necessary files are produced in the right sequence.

1. Execute "file_conversion.py". In the code the path to the input files "corpus.txt" and "labels.txt" should be changed according to where they are saved. The code will print the number of lines of the output file "csv_file.csv", which will be saved to the same folder where the code is.
2. Execute "lemmatization.py", after changing the path for the input file "csv_file.csv", according to where it is saved. The code will print the number of lines of the output file "lemmatized_file.csv", which will be saved to the same path where the code is.
3. To perform kmeans and mini batch kmeans, execute "kmeans.py". In the code the path to the input file "lemmatized_file.csv" should be changed according to where it is saved. The code outputs the accuracy rate, other metrics, running time and plots the cloud words for the ten most important terms for each cluster identified by the algorithms.
4. Execute "svd.py" after changing the path for the input file "lemmatized_file.csv" according to where it is saved. The code performs svd and kmeans and outputs kmeans accuracy rate, other kmeans metrics, the running time and the cloud words for the ten most important terms for each cluster identified by the algorithm.
5. Execute "sampling.py" after changing the path for the input file "lemmatized_file.csv" according to where it is saved. The output file "sampled_file.csv" will be saved to the same path where the code is. 
6. Execute "pca.py" after changing the path for the input file "sampled_file.csv" according to where it is saved. The code performs pca and kmeans and outputs kmeans accuracy rate, other kmeans metrics, the running time and plots the cloud words for the ten most important terms for each cluster identified by the algorithm.
7. Execute "svd+centering.py" after changing the path for the input file "sampled_file.csv" according to where it is saved. The code performs pca through data centering and svd and applies kmeans. The output comprehends kmeans accuracy rate, other kmeans metrics, the running time and plots the cloud words for the ten most important terms for each cluster identified by the algorithm.
